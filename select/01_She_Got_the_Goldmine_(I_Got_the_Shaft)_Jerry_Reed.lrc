[00:09.52] Well, I guess it was back in '63
[00:11.38] When eatin' my cookin' got the better of me
[00:13.48] So I asked this little girl I was goin' with to be my wife
[00:16.26] Well, she said she would, so I said "I do"
[00:19.73] But I'da said I wouldn't if I'da just knew
[00:22.13] How sayin' "I do" was gonna screw up all of my life!
[00:48.13] 
[00:25.04] Well, the first few years weren't all that bad
[00:29.17] I'll never forget the good times we had
[00:30.85] Cause I'm reminded every month when I send her the child support.
[00:33.49] Well, it wasn't too long till the lust all died
[00:37.38] And I'll admit I wasn't too surprised
[00:39.23] The day I come home and found my suitcase sittin' out on the porch.
[01:12.73] 
[00:42.46] Well, I tried to get in she changed the locks!
[00:45.80] Then I found this note taped on the mailbox
[00:48.17] That said, "Goodbye, turkey! My attorney will be in touch!"
[00:52.48] So I decided right then and there
[00:54.31] I's gonna do what's right give her her fair share
[00:57.07] But brother I didn't know her share's gon' be THAT much!
[01:25.07] 
[00:59.90] She got the gold mine! She got the gold mine!
[01:03.75] I got the shaft. I got the shaft
[01:04.64] They split it right down the middle
[01:07.05] And then they give her the better half
[01:09.07] Well, it all sounds sorta funny
[01:11.37] But it hurts too much to laugh
[01:13.24] She got the gold mine - I got the sha-a-aft
[01:34.74] 
[01:17.38] Now, listen you ain't heard nothin' yet
[01:22.77] Why, they give her the color television set
[01:24.38] Then they give her the house, the kids, and both of the cars! See?
[01:29.63] Well, then they start talkin' 'bout child support
[01:31.73] Alimony, and the cost of the court
[01:34.18] Didn't take me long to figure out how far in the toilet I was!
[02:05.18] 
[01:36.86] I'm tellin' ya, they have made a mistake
[01:40.52] Cause it adds up to more than this cowboy makes!
[01:42.27] Besides; everything I ever had worth takin', they've already took!
[01:45.22] While she's livin' like a queen on alimony
[01:48.56] I'm workin' two shifts eatin' baloney
[01:50.60] Askin' myself, "Why didn't you just learn how to cook?!?!"
[02:19.60] 
[01:54.27] They give her the gold mine! She got the gold mine!
[01:57.23] They give me the shaft. I got the shaft
[01:58.86] They said they're splittin' it all down the middle
[02:01.26] But she got the better half
[02:03.21] Well, it all sounds mighty funny
[02:05.59] But it hurts too much to laugh
[02:07.43] She got the gold mine - I got the sha-a-aft
[02:28.93] 
[02:12.32] Well, she got the gold mine! She got the gold mine!
[02:31.97] I got the shaft. I got the shaft
[02:33.52] They split it all down the middle
[02:35.73] And then they give her the better half
[02:37.74] Well, I guess it all sounds funny, Hoo, hoo, hoo, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
[02:41.13] But it hurts too much to laugh
[02:42.39] She got the gold mine - I got the sha-a-aft
[02:45.79] (They ain't kiddin' me I got the shaft)
[03:05.29] 
[02:50.29] Well, I don't have to worry 'bout totin' a billfold n'more
[02:55.76] Hahahahaha
[02:58.26] I let my wife tote it; I'mon' be carryin' food stamps
[03:01.73] You get it, judge? I'mon' be... Just... Hahahaha
[03:25.73] 
[03:04.74] Ah, it's not funny, huh? Huh? Huh
[03:06.74] Contempt of court? Whaddaya mean?
[03:10.22] Listen, judge: I's just kiddin'!
